    <h3>About Page</h3>

 <p> Hello! To anyone who is viewing this page, I would like to welcome you to my website! My name is Javier Hernandez and I am a student who attends Kennesaw State University. I am currently a junior and I am majoring in Information Technology. Outside of school I enjoy activities such as exercising, playing video games, and traveling.</p>

 <p> As far as experience in information technology goes, I’ve gained some knowledge in this field. For example, I’ve learned how to code by taking two coding classes. Now I have knowledge on how to code in two different languages (Java and Python). Another example of gaining knowledge in information technology is web development. I’m taking a class that focuses on creating websites. This website is a prime example of what I learned from web development. </p>

 <p> As I wind down my journey here at Kennesaw State University, I do have a few goals that I want to focus on. For instance, one goal that I have is that I want to graduate by the end of 2025. I have less than 3 semesters worth of classes so I would like to be done with school till then. Another goal I have is to gain an internship at a tech job during my senior year of college. My goal is to gain experience during my internship so I can officially have a job by the time I’m done with school. </p>
